        "We Were Here" is an ongoing project, dedicated to repurposing family photographs that were destroyed during the
        2020 floods in Karachi.
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>
<div class="flexcontb">
      <div class="bodytext4">
        The project reimagines lost memories through a series of collages composed of scanned images, accompanied by
        flowing water animations. The centerpiece is an interactive installation that allows viewers to immerse
        themselves in the floods through the artwork, connecting the audience to the essence of the narrative.

    <div class="flexcontb">
          <div class="bodytext3">
            Could the memories that existed within these photographs find a way to survive through these altered forms?
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="flexcontb">

          <div class="bodytext4"> The goal of this project is to explore this question, while also serving as a way for
            me to come to terms with the sudden loss of those memories, and provide them with a proper farewell.
            It is an exploration of loss, grief, family and the impermanence of memories, especially within the context
            of climate change-induced trauma.

          "The 2020 Karachi floods (Urdu: سيلاب کراچی ) were the worst flooding Karachi had seen in almost a century,
          and killed at least 41 people across Pakistan. The floods were caused by record monsoon rains, which were
          inadequately drained by poorly maintained drainage systems in the city. The resulting floods caused deaths and
          destruction of infrastructure and properties in the city." </div>

  <div class="bodytext4">Our basement, typically a space for storage, was severaly affected by the flooding, with water
    rising to nearly 9 feet. Among the items that were submerged were furniture, books, musical instruments, and most
    significantly, almost all of our family photographs.

    Many of these photographs did not have digital or physical copies, and were irreparably altered.

    The animations below were used in the interactive installation. They were created by stitiching together several recovered photographs and scrolling through them, creating a endless loop. They were further processed using After Effects, TouchDesigner and GLSL to give the effect of flowing water, which the viewer could interact with through a Kinect camera.
